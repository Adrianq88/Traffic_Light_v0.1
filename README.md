# Traffic_Light_v0.1 - Microcontroller Project in C

## Project Description
Traffic_Light_v0.1 is a microcontroller-based project written in C for embedded systems. It simulates a basic traffic light control system using LED displays and signal lights. The project operates by connecting various components such as a microcontroller board, LED display, and traffic signal lights.

## Features
- Implements a basic traffic light control system using microcontrollers.
- Utilizes a microcontroller board and LED displays for visual representation.
- Alternates between two traffic signal lights, counting down the time until the next color change.

## Hardware Requirements
- Microcontroller board
- LED display
- Traffic signal lights

## How to Use
1. Connect the required hardware components to the microcontroller board.
2. Compile all files and upload the 'main.c' source code to the microcontroller.
3. Power on the system.
4. Observe the traffic light simulation on the connected LED display and signal lights.
